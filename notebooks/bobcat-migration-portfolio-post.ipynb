    "\n",
    "Bobcats are part of the larger genus of Lynx. There are 4 extant species\n",
    "of Lynx, one of which is the bobcat. The bobcat is often confused with the\n",
    "Lynx, but the key difference is that Lynx are larger and their tails are \n",
    "all black versus the Bobcat which have white tails with a black strip.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the bobcat *'lynx rufus'* to look at their migration because I \n",
    "have a sister who works at the Sonoma County Wildlife Rescue in \n",
    "California. She does the [rescue and release](https://scwildliferescue.org/rescue-rehab-release) \n",
    "part of the porgram and they frequently rescue injured bobcats, or get in baby \n",
    "bobcats that were abandoned in some way that they care for until they \n",
    "are old enough to be released. I however, am in Colorado and I have seen\n",
    "bobcats in the wilderness. This made me curious about their overall migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This species's migration ranges between Mexico and Canada, with the \n",
    "majority of the bobcats being found in the U.S. They are not a threatened\n",
    "species, but do suffer from habitat loss. They \"live in a wide variety of\n",
    "habitats, including boreal coniferous and mixed forests in the north, \n",
    "bottomland hardwood forests and coastal swamps in the southeast, and \n",
    "desert and scrublands in the southwest\"(The Smithsonian National Zoo &\n",
    "Conservation Biology Institute). Another important note that will\n",
    "inform the later interpretation is that bobcats do not hibernate and are\n",
    "most active during the winter, particularly January and February which \n",
    "is their mating season (The Wildlife Rescue Legaue).\n",

    "* #### Ecoregion Data\n",
    "Ecoregions are \"are areas that are geographically and ecologically similar\n",
    "and experience similar levels of solar radiation and precipitation\". \n",
    "There are 846 Ecoregions globally, but most species would be in a small\n",
    "portion of those edoregions depending on their habitats and migration patterns.\n",

    "governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data \n",
    "about all types of life on Earth\"(Data Info citation below). This network\n",
    "draws many data sources together including museum specimans, DNA barcodes,\n",
    "and crowdsourced photos from smartphones used by non-experts and experts.\n",
    "GBIF uses data standards to index all these species records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data can vary:\n",
    "1. There may be more occurances recorded in National Parks \n",
    "compared to the Arctic, even if the species may similarly present\n",
    "in different regions. This is because there are fewer people to observe in \n",
    "the arctic. \n",
    "2. There may be greater or fewer occurances depending on time of year \n",
    "that people go outside, how accesible a region is during different times\n",
    "of year, etc.\n",
    "3. There may be variation depending on how many people want to provide/upload\n",

    "Because the GBIF data can vary by space and time, the data needs to be \n",
    "normalized to account for these issues that would otherwise skew the plot\n",
    "(ex. make it look like there are more observations in a certain area or time\n",

    "The data was normalized by ecoregion samples, by month samples, and by \n",
    "area. This way the normalization is over space and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before normalization can happen, the GBIF data was converted into a \n",
    "GeoDataFrame using latitude and longitude geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, a spatial join was performed with parameters (how= 'inner', \n",
    "predicate= 'contains'). This identifies the Ecoregion for each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, observations were grouped by Ecoregion, selecting only month/ecosystem\n",
    "combinations that have more than one occurance recorded (since a single\n",
    "occurence could be an error). The .groupby() and .mean() methods were used\n",
    "to compute the mean occurences by ecoregion and by month.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Lastly, divide occurrences by the mean occurrences by month AND the mean\n",
    "occurrences by ecoregion.\n",
